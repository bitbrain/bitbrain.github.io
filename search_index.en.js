should I even upload my games automatically?\n\nThis is a good question. Simple answer is, that during a gamejam you can fully concentrate on building your game. Especially, when the deadline is coming closer, you simply have to commit and push your changes, in order to trigger an automatic deployment of your game to itch.io:\n\nmake a code or asset change change locally\ncommit your change via Git and push it to Github\nTravisCI automatically picks up your change and builds your game\nTravisCI automatically pushes the new build to itch.io\n\nThis tutorial shows you how to do that!\nPrequisites\nFor this tutorial, we use the following technologies:\n\nGithub to version control our game code\nTravisCI as a build agent to build our game\nitch.io to host our game\nButler to upload our game builds to itch.io\n\nSetup Github repository\nIf not already done, create a Github repository to host our source code:\n\nSetup itch.io\nBefore we can start uploading our first game, we need to create an itch.io game project:\n\nAfter your project is created, head over to your account settings to generate a new API key. This key is required so other services such as TravisCI are able to communicate with itch.io.\n\nPrepare TravisCI deployment\nOnce the repository exists and itch.io is prepared, we need to prepare TravisCI. This consists of the following steps:\n\ncreate deployment script\ncommit and push travis.yml\nprepare TravisCI project\nsetup BUTLER_API_KEY\n\nCreate deployment script\nThis script will take your artifacts and push it to itch.io. Create a new file, called deploy.sh:\n\nThis script first checks, if the environment variable BUTLER_API_KEY is defined. This variable can be setup within Travis and is required for itch.io to authenticate your game upload.\nAfterwards we define a bunch of helper functions. Then we download the latest version of butler and upload the game with it. Please ensure to configure the correct project.\nSetup .travis.yml\nThis file is required by TravisCI to understand how to build your game. For example, you can setup a Java environment (for Java games) or Objective-C environment (for Unity games). TravisCI ensures that this environment is set up and it will build your game:\n\nFeel free to create a different .yml for Java, C++ or even Android! Read more about that in the official docs.\nPrepare TravisCI project\nNow we have to configure our TravisCI project. Head over to https://travis-ci.org, authenticate with your Github account and you should be able to import your Github project from there. Once imported, head over to the settings to configure environment variables:\n\n\nRun the build\nCongratulations! You successfully set up the pipeline. Let's run the build to see how your game automatically publishes:\n\nYour latest game version is now available on itch.io:\n\n","id":"https://bitbra.in/blog/automatically-publish-games-to-itchio/","title":"How to automatically publish your game to itch.io"},"https://bitbra.in/blog/cd-with-travis/":{"body":"Some years ago I started working on a project called braingdx. It is a gamejam framework based on libgdx, fully written in Java. At some point I decided to make the artifact available for a broader audience. As a result I required a deployment flow to automatically upload the .jar files to an artifactory of my choice.\nThe silly approach\nI just wanted to publish artifacts, but not on each commit. Instead, I decided to go for a multi-branch configuration like this:\n\nWe have a master branch where we commit on. When we decide to release an artifact, we manually (locally) merge into deploy, push the changes and Travis CI will pickup the build, thanks to the .travis.yml file configured:\n\nThe configuration file has a before_install section. In there we use a tool written by me called chime. We run this tool as a Docker container to extract version and changelog information from a CHANGELOG.md provided. For example, we have a file like this:\n\nThe resulting environment variables would look like this (after before_install execution):\n\nUsing this approach we can define versions within a CHANGELOG.md file and it should automatically pick up the latest version from the file. We update the version of the library temporarily via mvn versions:set with the latest version extracted from the changelog file.\nAfterwards we run a deploy.sh script during the install stage:\n\nI configured a custom Nexus inside my settings.xml to push my artifacts to. Users of my library then would need to add the repository via repository statement in their configuration.\nSilly approach, lots of problems\nThe approach worked fine, however it was not as refined as I hoped it to be:\n\nmy custom Nexus caused SSL Certificate issues on some Windows and Mac machines when trying to download dependencies\nit is truly cumbersome to manually switch between master and deploy locally and merge all the time\nthe current multi-branch approach causes lots of merge commits (if we are not able to fast-forward)\nsometimes you would forget to switch from deploy back to master locally and suddenly commiting on a wrong branch\nnot easy to have a mapping from version to commit history (missing tagging functionality)\nTravis only builds the deploy branch, not the master branch. We never truly compile each commit on master nor run any tests\n\nAfter putting some thought into it I came up with a much better, more light-weighted approach.\nOne branch to rule them all\nI eventually decided to get rid of the deploy branch after all. All commits should go to master and should be tested and/or deployed on Travis. I would keep the CHANGELOG.md version extraction and do additional checks to avoid deploying already deployed versions twice:\n\nThe new flow is executed whenever a new commit is pushed onto master:\n\ncheckout from SCM\nextract version and changelog from CHANGELOG.md\nSign artifacts - this is required in order to push artifacts to Maven Central\nInstall/Deployment\n\nverify if the latest git tag is different than version extracted. Run deployment when extracted version from CHANGELOG.md is newer\nwhen there is no difference in version, the version had been deployed already. Instead, run unit tests and generate code coverage reports\n\n\nUpload additional artifacts\n\nhappens on after_install stage\nwhen the new version is different than the latest tag create a new Github Release which will automatically create a new tag with the current version\nupload latest Javadoc to Github\n\n\n\nIn the rest of this article I will explain how some of these steps work in detail.\nSign your Artifacts\nIn order to upload your artifacts to Central you require to sign your artifacts with a GPG signature. I recommend reading this tutorial to learn how to do that.\nIn the tutorial the author explains that we want to encrypt our codesigning.asc file to prevent strangers from stealing it. We do that by installing and using the travis CLI:\n\nWhen running this I discovered that Travis would fail the build:\n\nWhat is going on?! I followed the tutorial step by step and for me it did not want to work. After hours of desperation and crying on the floor I found something on Github. Apparently, on my Windows 10 machine the travis encrypt-file operation is broken and produces a corrupted encryption. WOW! Thanks for that. How did I fix it? A little bit of Docker 🐳 for the win. Let's create a Dockerfile:\n\nAnd then:\n\nAfter committing the codesigning.asc.enc file Travis was able to decrypt the GPG private key which is required to sign the artifacts.\nCheck if version is changed\nIn order to check if the version has changed I did the following during the before_install stage:\n\nAfter that we can deploy or just run the tests, depending of the version:\n\nPushing new release to Github\nIn order to push the new release automatically to Github, we do the following on the after_install stage:\n\nThis will ensure that a latest release has been pushed (including latest changelog content from CHANGELOG.md and Github will automatically create a tag for us. Next time we run the pipeline, it won't deploy again since the tag has been updated.\nUploading Javadoc to Github pages\nUploading Javadoc to Github pages is a little bit more tricky. I want to have the following requirements fullfilled:\n\neach version is persisted in Github pages, e.g. /docs/1.0.0\nthe latest docs should be available via /docs/latest\n\n\nClick here to see an example of the generated page created.\nConclusion\nThe new flow allows me to have:\n\nsingle branch\nevery commit is tested in Travis\nI control deployments via CHANGELOG.md\nGithub releases and tags are automatically created\nJavadoc is automatically created\non release, artifacts are signed and pushed to Maven Central\n\nDo you have feedback?

It builds upon libgdx and extends it with game engine features to avoid writing boilerplate-code.\nIn this part I will present how the tiledmap integration works in braingdx compared to libgdx itself. As mentioned before, this framework uses libgdx and its APIs in order to integrate tiled maps.\nWhy extending already existing tiledmap support?\nBefore I started writing my own framework, I would use something like this to get tiledmaps drawn onto screen:\n\nThis will render your multi-layered map onto the screen. Job is done then. Or  is it? Before I even started thinking about writing a tiledmap integration, I had to know the challenges ahead of me. I realised that using a simple OrthogonalTiledMapRenderer does not do the trick at all: the problem are game objects itself.\n\na game object is a stateful, dynamic object within a game world which represents anything the player can interact with: characters, items, events, etc.\n\nGiven a multi-layered map like this in Tiled:\n\nDo you note the bridge? How can I achieve that the player gets either rendered below the bridge (when walking beneath it) or is walking on the bridge? What about automatic collision detection? How can I prevent that the player is able to fall off the bridge, but can walk beneath it without problems? All these challenges can not be solved by using OrthogonalTiledMapRenderer.\nInstead, you have to write your own z-index ordering logic. Don't worry though, these challenges have been solved within braingdx:\n\nThat's all you need! In this blog series I am going to show you how I achieved that.\nHow braingdx renders stuff onto the screen\nBefore we get to the meat, let us talk a bit about how my framework actually displays stuff and why it does it that way. This is important to know so it becomes easier to integrate tiled maps directly into the framework:\n\nThe framework renders different layers onto each other which result in the final frame:\n\nFirst, it renders the background layer, this is mostly something like a parallax layer or a static background image.\nOnto the background, we can now render the game world. Simply put, the game world contains dynamic game objects which can change attributes like position, shape, rotation etc. dynamically\nThe lighting is rendered onto all previous layers.\nAt last, we can now render the UI onto the screen\n\nSince this order is static, where do we render our tiled map? Rendering it as part of the background layer does not allow us to render game objects behind particular layers. So, we have to render the tiledmap somehow as part of the game world.\nBringing everything together\nInitially, I never wanted to write my own framework. Reinventing the wheel should be avoided whenever possible. We can save a ton of time by just using what already exists. However, in case of tiled maps I could not find a single solution which satisfies my requirements.\nWhen creating this framework, I did not want to force new APIs onto the user - many parts are just re-using existing libgdx APIs. In case of tiled maps, I found a very simple solution to my problem:\n\nbraingdx treats each tiledmap layer as an individual game object and renders them as part of the world layer.\n\nEach game object has its own z-index, which defines the order in which game objects are rendered. When drawing tiledmap layers as part of the gameworld render process, it allows us to have dynamic ordering. However, this begs a question:\nWhat should be the z-index of a particular tiledmap layer?\nThe formular looks as follows:\n\nThe layerIndex is the number of the layer, counting from 0 upwards. The rows attribute is the number of total rows as part of the tiled map. Finally, the yIndex is the vertical index of the cell, the particular game object is currently on.\nAs a concrete example, let's imagine the following setup:\n\na 10x10 orthogonal tiledmap with a tile resolution of 32x32 pixels\nthe map consists of 2 tiled layers and a single object layer in between those\na player object is located on the object layer at position x = 60, y = 110\n\nbraingdx will automatically compute the z-index according to the given properties.\nAt first, the framework calculates the so called yIndex as follows:\n\nSo the game object is positioned at a yIndex of 3. The framework does not have a concept of object layers, since each game object is rendered separately, depending on their position. Instead, braingdx only keeps tiledmap layers. A game object is always translated onto the layer underneath. So, a tiledmap layer above the game object will always be rendered above the game object. As a result, the layerIndex of the assigned tiledmap layer is 0.\nThis results to the following computation:\n\nSo the player at its current position will have a zIndex of 7. This is all done by braingdx internally. Since game objects are rendered in the order of their zIndex attribute, it is ensured that game objects can be dynamically drawn before or after a particular tiledmap layer.\nWhat about tiledmap layers then?\nWe have learned how braingdx computes zIndex of game objects and that all game objects are drawn in the order of that index value. However, what about the layers itself? You might remember, that braingdx treats an entire tiledmap layer as a single game object. This means that braingdx does the following when loading tiled maps:\n\niterate over all layers of the tiledMap\nin case of a object layer, add a new game object to the game world and assign all the properties such as dimensions, position, type etc. to the game object\nin case of a tiledmap layer, add a new game object to the game at position x = 0, y = 0 and set the game object to active = false. This ensures that the layer itself is excluded from collision detection\n\nSince the framework separates the rendering of game objects, we have to define an own GameObject2DRenderer for our tiledmap objects:\n\nThe render method will be called whenever our tiledmap layer object gets drawn. Since we want to ensure that each layer has its own renderer, we have to generate the game object type for the tiledmap layer and register it to the RenderManager:\n\nConclusion\nA lot of time is wasted during gamejams sorting out render issues with tiledmaps. Modern game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine will do that for you - however for us Java folks there is not a simple way. Most of the time, we copy-paste together config from gamedev forums or Github, but we always had to re-invent the wheel each time. With braingdx this changes everything!\nCheckout braingdx and see for yourself: it can save you a lot of time when participating in gamejams!\n","id":"https://bitbra.in/blog/creating-braingdx-orthogonal-tilemaps/","title":"Creating braingdx: orthogonal tilemaps"},"https://bitbra.in/blog/devlog-youtubers/":{"body":"For many years, I remained quiet and built a lot of little games just for fun. I may have shared progress on them on Twitter but that's it. To be completely honest, I was afraid people might not like what I am doing or that my work is not good enough for the world to see.\nFinally, after years of hiding, I decided this year to become a Youtuber! Before I go into details, let me first talk a little bit about Youtube a bit, especially the game development section.\nThe four types of gamedev content\nBefore I became a creator, I used to only watch devlogs myself. I am probably subscribed to over 80 different creators and each of them has their unique strengths. Generally, they can be categorised as follows:\nType A: The informative Game Developer\nThis type focuses purely on sharing knowledge and learnings without wasting anyones time. Entertainment-first is not a priority but rather showing progress. A very good example of this is Miziziziz - he is the master of efficiency when it comes to condensing information within a single video. What also makes him great is that Miziziziz is very knowledgable in the stuff he's doing!\n\nType B: The relaxed Game Developer\nSometimes, after a hectic day, you just want to relax and not worry about consuming information as quickly as possible. Rather, you'd like to watch someone explaining thoroughly their process and how to live a healthy, productive life. One of my favourite Youtubers, devduck, is a prime-example of this. His editing style is always very relaxed but also kinda melancholic. Watching his videos really motivated me to get up early in the morning (we're talking like 5am) to enjoy game development in its fullest.\n\nType C: The Entertainer\nYou find most devlogs dry and boring and always skip most of it? You prefer watching Twitch streamers for their personality? You like banter and swear just for fun? Then Randy is your guy! One of my favourite videos is Simulating every single pixel in my game. In that particular episode, Randy shows off various alter-ego characters, each having a particular responsibility. In addition, his Australian accent makes the videos highly enjoyable (if you like that kind of humour).\n\nType D: The Newcomer\nSometimes it surprises me to see brilliant videos but the creators have less than 1000 subscribers. It amazes me how many awesome creators are out there, and almost nobody watched their videos yet. A few of these newcomers are (in my opinion) on-par with the \"big ones\" such as devduck or heartbeast. What makes these creators so unique is their personality, the editing style and the type of content they create. For example Obvious Dev is an aspiring game developer from Germany, working on his game called Exo Colony. Like me, he is quite German and we have a severe lack of German game developers on Youtube. Let's unite!\n\nAnother great Youtuber is Element Mill. I discovered him by accident and his production value is comparable to a creator with a few million subscribers. Insanity!\nMy Youtube channel\nAfter I got inspired by all those awesome creators, I decided for myself to join the bunch and become a Youtuber myself. I wanted to produce devlogs, document my workflows and show my struggles and achievements. I bought myself a CANON M50 and a Blue Yeti Microphone and started filming my first video.\nSuddenly I realised: what kind of style do I actually aim for? I really don't find myself funny, so probably trying to push for Funny/Entertainer content might be not ideal. Then I thought: Why even trying to fit into a box? Just do whatever! which is initially very difficult. So, I went ahead and created my first two videos:\n\nI build my first crafting game in Godot Engine!\nLighting and inventory update for my Godot crafting game!\n\nI have received dozens of comments and a lot of feedback. While creating these videos, I tried not to copy any of the previouslu mentioned Youtubers but simply did what I found interesting/fun to do. In handsight, I accidentally tried to copy some things from other Youtubers by filling my videos with so called B-Roll (the content between the content). In my last video, I might have even overdone this and lost focus on what I actually wanna do: show insights into my gamedev process.\n\nExpectations vs. Reality\nBefore I created my first video, I thought it would be rather easy to produce content. When editing for many hours just to create a few minutes of content, I had to learn that it is very exhausting and challenging to do this kind of work. Another learning was that it can be rather tempting to produce content for the clicks rather than just focusing on the content itself. Regardless, I would have never expected to get that many followers in just a few months. Over 300 people have subscribed to my channel already and over 4000 views have accumulated! Thank you for everyone joining my gamedev journey.\nThe future\nIn 2021, I have big plans for my Youtube channel. Obviously, I will continue my devlog series on cave but also I have plans to do different types of content such as interviews, collaborations and tutorials!\nStay tuned. ♥\n","id":"https://bitbra.in/blog/devlog-youtubers/","title":"Becoming a gamedev Youtuber"},"https://bitbra.in/blog/godot-addon-compatibility/":{"body":"Godot addons offer a powerful way to extend the engine's functionality without having to modify its core. This flexibility empowers the community to create custom solutions without burdening the engine itself. However, as addon developers, we must strike a balance between compatibility and functionality. This article explores the trade-offs involved, focusing primarily on Godot Engine 4.x.\nThe Anatomy of a Godot Release\nGodot currently has two major versions in circulation:\n\nGodot 3.x: This older version is known for its stability and backward compatibility. It's particularly useful for projects that require lighter hardware capabilities, such as mobile games.\nGodot 4.x: This is the newer, more advanced version, boasting superior graphics capabilities through Vulkan and significant reworks of various systems.\n\nEach major version consists of minor versions (e.g., Godot 4.0, 4.1, etc.) that mainly introduce new features and bug fixes. These are followed by maintenance versions (e.g., 4.0.1, 4.1.2) focusing on bug fixes, compatibility improvements, and minor UX enhancements. Typically, maintenance releases are non-API-breaking.\nCrafting a Compatibility Matrix\nWhen developing addons, it's crucial to consider which Godot features you'll be using from the outset. Suppose you have an addon compatible with all minor versions of Godot 4.x. Your initial compatibility matrix might look like this:\nGodot VersionAddon Version\n4.0.x1.0.x\n4.1.x1.0.x\n\nLet's say Godot 4.1 introduces a new feature called static variables:\n\nUsing this feature would make your addon incompatible with Godot 4.0.x. You now have three options:\nOption 1: Maintain Support for Godot 4.0\n\n✅ Maximum flexibility\n⛔️ High administrative overhead\n\nGodot VersionAddon Version\n4.0.x1.0.x\n4.1.x1.1.x\n\nYou could maintain a separate 1.0 branch for Godot 4.0.x compatibility, cherry-picking bug fixes as needed. This approach increases administrative overhead, especially if you're using Continuous Integration.\nOption 2: Drop Support for Godot 4.0\n\n✅ Access to all new features\n⛔️ Risk of alienating some users\n\nGodot VersionAddon Version\n4.1.x1.1.x\n\nBy dropping support for older versions, you can fully utilize the new features but may lose users who are still on Godot 4.0.x.\nOption 3: Maintain Broad Compatibility\n\n✅ Broad user base\n⛔️ Limited access to new features\n\nGodot VersionAddon Version\n4.x1.x\n\nThis approach minimizes administrative work but restricts you from using newer features.\nWhich Option to Pick?\nThe best approach depends on various factors:\n\nUser Base: Check issue stats to gauge the popularity of different Godot versions.\nFeature Importance: Assess how critical new Godot features are for your addon's functionality.\nAdministrative Overhead: Be realistic about the time and effort you can invest in maintaining multiple branches.\nBackporting: Consider whether a feature could be backported to older versions, especially if it's a game-changer.\n\nSupporting Godot 3.x\nIf you wish to support both Godot 3 and 4, you can maintain separate branches for each. For example, my addon beehave has two branches: godot-4.x and godot-3.x, each tailored to its respective Godot version.\n","id":"https://bitbra.in/blog/godot-addon-compatibility/","title":"Godot Version Compatibility: A Guide for Addon Developers"},"https://bitbra.in/blog/godot-file-compression/":{"body":"I am maintaining a Godot Engine addon called Pandora and maintainers reported a very strange bug that I solved in this pull request:\nThe compression of the data.pandora file was not working and in this blog article I want to explain how compression in Godot works, how I solved it and maybe you can learn a thing or two!\n\nWhy compression?\nCompression is by no means a way to encrypt your data. Someone with malicious intent can decompress the contents and modify it to their needs. However, compression is still useful to reduce the size of the final .pck file that gets shipped with your Godot game. Also, as an added bonus, it will be much harder for someone without technical knowledge to modify e.g. raw json files.\nStoring JSON\nImagine you have some json like so:\n\nand you want to store that to a file. Usually, in Godot you can do this:\n\nThis then allows you to write to the file our item like so:\n\nStoring compressed files\nSo far, so good. Now, how would we actually store compressed files? The code looks surprisingly similar!\n\nSo, what is the problem here if this code works fine? It has to do with exporting your game in Godot!\nExporting addon files\nWhen someone uses a Godot addon that relies on specific files (such as data.pandora files for storing state), those files will not be automatically exported.\n\nPandora does not use a .json but rather .pandora extension on purpose to discourage people from modifying it manually.\n\nWhen exporting the game, one would need to define the exported files explicitly in the export settings:\n\nHowever, this is not sustainable and having to remember to register random files whenever you want to export your game does not scale. This is why Godot introduced the EditorExportPlugin:\n\nAs you can see, this plugin gets shipped with the addon and it allows the addon creator to specify additional files that should be auto-exported when someone uses the addon. In Pandora, the data.pandora file should not be compressed by default when being used in the editor but only for release builds. Reason being is that it is much more friendly for version control systems like git and it also makes debugging things easier within Pandora itself.\nThe is_debug flag tells us if someone intents to export a game as debug or release build, so we can use the flag to conditionally add the file.\n\nNote: the path argument of the _export_begin method is the path where the game will be exported to.\n\nThe add_file signature requires a PackedByteArray as a 2nd argument, which effectively is the bytes of the file that should be stored away:\n\nso, how do we store the file compressed? We cannot use open_compressed here because the file we are trying to store compressed is uncompressed:\n\nA first idea I had was to compress the PackedByteArray itself:\n\nthe assumption is that the exported file can be opened like this when running your release build of your game at runtime:\n\nHowever, that fails with error code 15. What on earth is that error? I highly recommend bookmarking the official Godot docs, because they are extremely useful, especially for situations like this: we find our answer in the ancient archives under the Error section (link):\n\nError ERR_FILE_UNRECOGNIZED = 15\nFile: Unrecognized error.\n\nAh, so Godot itself does not recognize the file as compressed!\nSolving the mystery\nI reached out on the official Godot Contributor chat and contributor bruvzg kindly provided me with this information:\n\n[...] you can replicate compressed file format if you want it to be readable with open_compressed, it's not complex, the mine difference compressing is done in blocks, format is:\n\n\nIn case you are confused now, stay with me - this all will make sense in a bit. The format you are seeing there is not code but it describes bytes that need to be present in the compressed file for Godot to understand it. Picture it like a recipe or instruction manual that is stored at the beginning of your file and Godot will read that to understand what to do with your compressed content.\nWhat are bytes anyway?\nTo decompress for a bit (pun intended), let us take a step back and understand how our exported file actually looks like. Remember, we previously attempted to export our file like so:\n\nWe can use a nifty tool like GodotPCKExplorer to inspect + unpack exported Godot builds. This becomes especially useful to investigate the export logic of our EditorExportPlugin. Opening the pck file to our exported release build of our game indeed shows the file:\n\nWe then can click Extract &gt; Extract Selected and save the file to a location of our choice. This then allows us to inspect the file furter. Opening that file in a text editor shows us an odd character:\n\nThis is because the file is compressed - there is a much better way at looking at the file itself, which is by using a hex editor, such as hexed.it:\n\nA char is precisely 1 byte, and looking at our compression spec again, Godot expects the first 4 bytes to consist of the following characters: GCPF, which would look like this:\n\nIn case a file does not start with these exact bytes, Godot will not be able to open it correctly. The same goes for the next byte headers: uint32_t is precisely 4 bytes, meaning the next 12 bytes should contain the compression_mode, block_size and uncompressed_size:\n\n\n00 00 00 00 is the compression mode - we pick the default which is MODE_ZSTD (0)\n00 10 00 00 represents 4096 as the block size\n1E 00 00 00 is the uncompressed size of our file = 30 bytes\n\nThe remaining bytes will be the compressed data that gets produced by compressing our PackedByteArray.\nApplying the knowledge\nWith our gained knowledge, let us create a new script that is able to compress any text into Godot compatible PackedByteArray format!\n\nWith this component, we can now easily adjust our previous code:\n\nWith the above trick, you can now open the file via open_compressed without problems!\nI hope you enjoyed this little sneakpeak into the development of my addon.

Specifically, the difference between RefCounted, Object and built-in types like String or Color. At the end of this post, you will understand the exact differences between them.\n\nThe Good: RefCounted and Built-in Types\nMany types in Godot such as AStar3D are of type RefCounted. Godot will keep track of how many references you have for a given instance. If the reference count becomes 0, the instance will be freed:\n\nThis can be extremely handy: you don't actually have to worry about freeing objects or any sort of memory management. Godot will take care of it automatically. Prefer RefCounted if you don't want to worry about freeing instances and you have mostly short-lived objects anyways.\nFor in-built types like Color or String, Godot utilizes value semantics, this means that when you assign a color or string, it will create always an independent copy.\n\nThe Bad: Object\nWell... not really bad. Just bad for beginners. Object type can bite you if you don't actually understand how it works! Godot will not free objects for you. When you are not careful, it can lead to a memory leak:\n\nIn order to free Object you have to call .free() on it. You are in luck, though: most Object instances that Godot creates (like nodes) it will free for you! So while technically, Object requires manual memory management, Godot will do a lot for you. However, when rolling your own Object types you need to be careful!\nThe Ugly: Invisible Side-Effects\nI have been recently contributing again to the FMOD GDExtension by utopia-rise because I was trying to investigate an issue in my game where no sound was playing. I won't go into too much technical detail here, but FMOD basically is an audo engine that I am using for my game. FMOD has the concept of \"audio banks\" that you gotta load at runtime, and those banks contain the audio to play. The code usually looks like this:\n\nThis used to work fine but at some point, it stopped working. After a long time of debugging, it turned out that the signature of load_bank had been changed. FmodBank no longer was of type Object but of type RefCounted!\n\nIf you have paid attention before, you should already know what the problem is: the GDExtension correctly loads the main.bank file into memory but we are actually not referencing it! Godot will then go ahead and free the instance again (because it is a RefCounted and its reference count reaches 0). So the correct fix is this:\n\nsince banks itself is a reference that will stay around as long the init.gd autoload is around (for the entire duration of the game's runtime). We are saved!\nConfusion about valid instances\nBefore we finish, I wanted to say a few more words about is_instance_valid. Code like this may seem confusing at first:\n\nbut this is intended behaviour: Color is an in-built type and won't have an instance id. is_instance_valid only operates on instance ids so Godot cannot know if it is valid or not -&gt; it will always be false.\nI hope this was somewhat useful. If you have follow up questions, you can always reach me on 🐘Mastodon or over at ⛅BlueSky.\n","id":"https://bitbra.in/blog/godot-types/","title":"Godot Types: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly"},"https://bitbra.in/blog/goodbye-jekyll/":{"body":"Jekyll is a Ruby based static site generator created by Github that I have been using for many many years. It pains me to say goodbye but today is the day where I moved my blog off Jekyll for good. It was a fun ride and most notably, I created jekyll-dash, a custom theme for Jekyll that had all the fancy features one would love to see from an SSG generator: tags, fontawesome, cool animations... and all that jazz. I did maintain that for many years but eventually, the fun turned into annoyance.\nToo many caveats\nWorking with Jekyll can be rather annoying, especially when trying to get it running on Github Pages. Yes, Github automatically deploys your Jekyll page without you having to worry about anything, unless you are trying to use anything other than these versions. Oh, you want to use Jekyll 4? Tough luck, you gotta roll your own workflow to deploy + build things.\nTo make matters worse, you cannot just \"install\" Jekyll and get started. You need to setup Ruby first, which itself has different versions, should you install Ruby 2? Should you install Ruby 3? People in the past stumbled on issues where using Ruby 3 did not work with Jekyll.\nThen, there is the gem system: this is not a Jekyll concept but comes from Ruby. The idea sounds neat: you can build a theme for Ruby and then bundle it into a \"gem\". Then, you can publish the gem and others can download it and use your Jekyll theme, without having to worry about checking out dubious git repositories or running some dodgy commands. Instead, in your Gemfile you can define dependencies like so:\n\nThe jekyll-dash there is my own theme I created. You may notice something, though: it has a ~&gt; 2, meaning that the version is 2.0—no, this is not because it is so advanced! I wanted to upgrade my blog to latest Jekyll features (Jekyll 4) and unfortunately, all jekyll gems stopped working and had to be upgraded, too. This was quite a pain to maintain and keeping track of which gems I can use under which circumstances made this whole setup rather cumbersome. The whole point of using Static Site Generation to me is to have a clean and elegant and minimal setup without any databases, without any annoyances. Just some files hosted in a repository and Bob's your uncle.\nZola!\nI went and researched what is trendy in 2025 and discovered some interesting alternatives:\n\nHugo seemed great but it is quite advanced and not a great fit for super-minimal blog setups\nPublii is another interesting approach to SSG. It seems very minimal and light-weight but again, too \"enterprisey\" for my liking. I NEED LESS!\nZola surprised me. It reminded me of the \"good old days\" and it seems to be extremely light-weight, and built in Rust\n\nI browsed their themes and was impressed. The boring theme was exactly what I was looking for. Also, the way it works is rather brilliant: you just use a binary to generate the page and that's it. Heck, it even comes with its own Github action!\nI'm excited to use this light-weight technology.\n","id":"https://bitbra.in/blog/goodbye-jekyll/","title":"Goodbye, Jekyll."},"https://bitbra.in/blog/host-your-own-blog-for-free-with-custom-domain/":{"body":"Github allows you to host your own websites via Github Pages.

Once checked out locally, let us create a custom orphan branch like this:\n\nThen head into Settings-&gt;Pages of your repository in Github and set your source branch of Github pages:\n\nThis will ensure that Github looks up any content on that branch and serves it automatically at the following url:\n\n2. Jekyll setup\nNext up, let us configure Jekyll on the main branch. Keep in mind that main has a different git history to gh-pages. We will not directly commit anything to gh-pages - instead, we host all the Jekyll files on the main branch only and let the Github Action do the rest!\nLet us configure Jekyll by generating a new site:\n\n(optional) build and test the Jekyll site locally:\n\nand then head over to http://127.0.0.1:4000 to view your page locally:\n\npush your Jekyll site to Github:\n\n3. Github Action\nThe Jekyll source files are sitting now on the main branch but we want to automatically build our website like we used to do earlier locally. For this we will use a Github action. This action will build our website and then force-push it to the gh-pages branch.\nCreate a new file under the folder .github/workflows/github-pages.yml. Github will look for any files hosted in the .github/workflows folder and run a so called action. Within that file, define the following:\n\nThis action will automatically take care of building your Jekyll page and pushing it to the gh-pages branch. Before this works we need to define a custom github token, as the default GH_TOKEN will not work within actions.\n\nMake sure to set this token to never expire and assign the following permissions:\n\nrepo\nworkflow\nwrite:packages (optional)\ndelete:packages (optional)\n\n\nATTENTION! NEVER reveal any of your tokens or hardcode them into your code. Hackers will use them to compromise your account!\n\nCopy the token that is shown and define a new secret within your repository called CUSTOM_GITHUB_TOKEN:\n\nNext, push your changes to your repository:\n\nWithin your repository on Github you should now seen a new action getting triggered:\n\n4. (optional) Setup custom domain\nHaving a long url such as https://bitbrain.github.io works but does not look very good on your CV. You can setup a custom domain like I have: https://bitbra.in this page is hosted on Github Pages but has a custom domain setup.\nCreate a new file called CNAME that contains your domain, for example:\n\nand commit and push that file. Now, head to Settings-&gt;Pages to setup your domain:\n\nThis will only work if you own the domain and you configured your CNAME entry correctly within your domain provider. Follow this guide to learn how to set up your custom domain within AWS.\nConclusion\nLet me know in the comments if you face any issues so I can keep this guide up-to-date!

You might notice that I have a particular animation style. At the current stage of development scape looks like this:\n\nThe game did not always look like that! I started creating initial mockups back in 2018. Back then all I knew was the following:\n\nsince I binged Mr. Robot during that time I really wanted to craft a \"hacker\" themed game\nI love the neon aspect of synthwave and cyberpunk - the game should have vibrant colours as well\nyou should be able to play the game like Yoo Ninja which is one of my favourite smartphone games ever created\nI thought it'd be pretty cool to play as a little virus, infecting a computer system\n\nAfter I thought about the initial design elements of the game I used Pyxel to create a first mockup. Keep in mind, this mockup is from 2018:\n\nRight after creating this mockup I pushed my first commit to Github. Within a couple of hours a prototype has been created with all game mechanics implemented: jumping and flipping gravity:\n\n\n\nNext I am going to explain how I approached the player animation.\nAnimating the player\nThe player is animated by using a 8x3 spritesheet with a sprite size of 8x8 pixel. All in all, spritesheets in scape are really tiny and I use a virtual camera ingame to zoom into the szene in order to magnify the pixel effect.\nThis is how the spritesheet looks like:\n\nThe first row is used for basic movement animation. The second row is animating wall climbing. When the player is climbing a wall and moves just vertically, that animation is activated. Also, when a player is cornered or blocked, the third row is used as an animation.\nThe animation itself is looping in a so called LOOP_PINGPONG fashion. All animation ingame is done by libgdx. When the player is jumping though, I am pausing the animation and resetting it to the initial index to achieve some kind of idle effect.\nLevel animation\nMore complex to animate are the level animations themselves. Each frame is handdrawn by me within Pyxel. This is really time-consuming but it is also fun to see a sprite coming \"to live\".\nI have created several spritesheets, each of them has a particular style or purpose:\n\nvertical spritesheet contains sprites which are vertically aligned. Animation frames are created from left to right of the spritesheet\nhorizontal spritesheet contains sprites which are horizontally aligned. Animation frames are created from top to bottom of the spritesheet\nblock spritesheet contains square sprites. Animation frames are created from left to right of the spritesheet.\n\nAfter a while I realised that it probably was a mistake creating horizontal spritesheets at all. The simple reason is extendability. In order to build my levels I use the famous Tiled Editor. In there you can import spritesheets and define animations. Unfortunately, Tiled is counting sprite indices from left to right, row by row. When I want to add more animations to my spritesheet, I have to increase the image size of it, which has an impact on all indices since Tiled requires to recompute those. That can lead to visual glitches and it is not clear what Tiled is doing behind the scenes. Be careful animating sprites vertically!\n\nWithin spritesheets, always animate frames from left to right and grow your spritesheet vertically in order to avoid glitches in editors such as Tiled!\n\nWithin a spritesheet itself an animation is structured as follows:\n\nIn order to achieve an affect of energy lines cycling through the wires, I carefully picked a pattern with decreasing colour vibrancy which travels through the tile itself. This is how the tile looks animated in Tiled:\n\nThen I simply have to create hundreds of these handdrawn animations, sounds simple, doesn't it? Well, I realised after a while that it breaks the immersion when the animations are not in sync. This made things far more complicated since it means that I not only have to animate each tile but also I have to consider sibling tiles to fluidly integrate with eachother.\nAnimating bytes\nWhen playing scape, the player has to collect so called bytes. Animating those bytes was much simpler than taking care of individual level tiles:\n\nIn-game I then used Universal Tween Engine to animate slight scaling. To improve visual fidelity I also added particle effects which I had created by using the 2D particle editor of libgdx:\n\nWithin my game code I then rendered these particle effects over the animated and scaled sprites. Later on I also implemented lighting to my game. At that point, I purposfully attached pink lights onto the byte objects so they are visible from the far!\nI really enjoy doing manual animation since you have more control over each individual pixel on the screen! The game will release later this year. In the meantime you can already download a pre-release version. Feel free to give me feedback either here or on twitter!

In this simple 2D puzzle game the player has to remember a certain path to progress to the next stage. When starting this project I had to decide if I give the player a static list of predefined levels. After some time I decided against it and went for a procedural generation approach. In this article I am going to explain how these levels are generated.\nThe Level\nTypical ingame level look like this:\n\nYou notice that the shapes are quite simple and the path is easy to remember. Therefore, as more you progress in the game as more complex the level become:\n\nHow to generate those levels? Well, first of all I am using libgdx for all my games. This Java library allows me to draw things on the screen and to define a framework to run my game with. Unfortunately, this library does not give me an \"out-of-the-box\" level generator. Thus, I had to write an algorithm myself.\nBiom Data\nLet us first describe how a level should get defined. I did not want to have a \"random\" algorithm which just appends more cells into random directions. The result would be a randomly formed snake where I wouldn't have any control over. At least I wanted control about various level aspects. Each level is composed out of multiple parts, so called biomes. A biom is defined Java code. Let us take a look at a typical L-Shape:\n\nThis L-Shape can be represented by a byte array:\n\nYou might notice that there is an extra entry in the array:\n\nBasically we are telling our level generation to always consider the last entry in a byte array as information about the number of columns in this specific biom. This is all we need as input. We now have full control over which parts should get used to compose a level.\nBiom Conversion\nWe need to prepare the input data (byte arrays) into a format the algorithm understands. This format is a so called Biom class with the following properties:\n\nbyte[][] data the biom as a 2-dimensional byte array (without metadata)\nint startX the x index on the biom where the player could possibly start\nint startY the y index on the biom where the player could possibly start\nint endX the x index on the biom where the player could leave\nint endY the y index on the biom where the player could leave\nint length the number of cells inside a biom\nint width the width of a biom (number of cells)\nint height the height of a biom (number of cells)\n\nWe now call a so called BiomFactory which creates a Biom object for us:\n\nIf you are interested in how this factory works internally check out the code on Github.\n","id":"https://bitbra.in/blog/level-generation-in-mindmazer/","title":"Level Generation in Mindmazer"},"https://bitbra.in/blog/minibeansjam5-building-a-game/":{"body":"\nBetween Friday 3rd-5th April 2020, German Rocketbeans TV hosted minibeansjam 5, a 48 hour gamejam. I submitted a game and managed to finish most bits right in time.\nThe purpose is not to win anything, it's more a fun thing to do and it challenges your skills in time management, setting priorities as well as health care. (yes, you NEED sleep!)\nPreparation\nPersonally, I need to be in the right mood to approach something like a gamejam. I am a quite emotional developer and if I feel down or unwell, my creativity kinda stalls. That's why I don't prepare for gamejams in general. As a general rule though, please consider the following before approaching any gamejam:\n\ngamejams are there to have fun. Do not stress yourself! I know it can quite daunting at first, however, we're all in the same boat. Enjoy it!\nfix your sleep cycle! There is nothing worse than a broken sleep cycle. I know, people have their preferred time to stay awake (some people even like to work only during night). This is completely fine. However, make sure you keep it consistent, since otherwise you might oversleep on the last day and miss the deadline.\nstay hydrated! prepare yourself with your favourite drink (sparkling water or still water is my favourite pick) - this keeps the brain cells active and moist!\nStay Away From Energy Drinks (SAFED)\nsharpen your tools on kick-off day, make sure you have everything already opened, preloaded etc. so you do not have to do it once the themes are announced.\nTogether is Better! find people who want to do it with you. I promise you it changes the entire experience.\n\nInterestingly, I purposefully did this game on my own. Initially, I was looking for a team but then I wanted to challenge myself: can I build a game including assets, programming, level design, game design, writing, sound design and music myself in such a short time?\n\nPicking a theme\nThe theme has been announced around 6pm on Friday:\nDer #miniBeansjam5 Countdown hat begonnen!Hier sind die Begriffe für das #GameJam Thema!Wählt mindestens 2 der 3 Begriffe: Explosion, Elastisch und/oder Jenseits.Die Zeit endet am Sonntag um 19:00 Uhr, also in 48 Stunden!Viel Spaß bei unserem #GameJam!#gamedev #rbtv pic.twitter.com/5Rnw3iR1OM— miniBeansjam (@minibeansjam) April 3, 2020 \nFor my all non-German friends, this basically says to pick one or more of the following themes:\n\nExplosion\nElastic\nBeyond\n\nThe themes are not super strict but can be interpreted in any way. Their main purpose is to guide your imagination! The first thing I always do is creating a mindmap:\n\nYou can use whatever tool you prefer for this, after a quick Google search I found mindmapmaker.org.\nI stared at my creation for a couple of minutes until I realised: I want to build a zombie shooter survival horror!\nSetting up the project\nThe next step for me is to set up a project. Many people also do offline games (like board games) where this obviously is not applicable.\nVersion control\nA version control system (VSC) like git helps you to track your changes over time. The idea is that every change you do to your project is stored in the cloud and can be accessed at any given time. For that, I use Github for that:\n\nIt is important to use a VSC since it can save you a lot of pain. Using something like Dropbox is very difficult once you want to play around with features but you do not have the concept of branches. Also, working with multiple people on the same file can be challenging with something like Dropbox. Version control becomes a MUST in bigger teams.\nGenerating the project files\nNext up I generate the project. I build all my games in Java, more specifically with frameworks like libgdx and braingdx. Then I commit the changes to Git and push them to my Github repository:\n\nObviously, using when something like Unity Engine, you'd push the project files of your Unity project.\nPlan your time wisely\nThis is the first critical stage. When I attended my first game jams a couple of years ago, I'd already rush ahead and implement features like health system, fighting, enemies or shooting. Those things are useful and make your game fun, however, now might not be the right time to do this. In my head, it looks a little bit like this:\n\nI call this the Gamejam Flow Pyramid (excuse my poor MSPaint skills. Also, arrows are now up to scale). The idea is the following:\n\nDay 1: working out the core mechanic of your game. After the first day, your game is basically already playable, but most likely is 0 fun since reward systems, UI, assets, etc. are missing. However, mechanically the foundation for your game is set.\nDay 2: Powermode! It's time to implement all your features, assets and build a basic (functional) UI. At the end of the day, mostly only polishing and nice-to-have features should be left. Also, do not worry about the game loop or menu flow, that's all for the last day.\nDay 3: Wrapping it up. Time to finish the game loop, build menu flows (logo screen -&gt; main menu -&gt; ingame -&gt; game over, etc.) . Also try to polish your game as much as possible: add particle effects, screen shake, more animations, etc. and add features you think will make the game more fun.\n\nObviously, this order is just a suggestion and always works for me the best. Also, for multi-disciplinary teams this order can be moved around or things like assets and levels can be prepared already on Day 1 while developers work on implementing game mechanics. On Day 2 and Day 3, artists, writers and composers can then work on polishing existing stuff or extend the game.\nDay 1: the dancing man\nAfter setting up my project, I opened my Pyxel Edit to create a simple tileset:\n\nI added a lot of variation to different grass tiles so the game looks okay when walking over a plain of grass. If you haven't seen tile sets like this yet: Tiled map editor has Terrain support and it makes things so much more easier to build nice-looking maps with the terrain editor:\n\nOnce the terrain has been defined, you can simply draw terrain within tiled:\n\nThat's all I needed for level design right now. Time to work on my core mechanic: the walking soldier. To achieve that, I wanted to do a 2.5-dimensional illusion where you can perceive depth:\n\nNext up I created the player tileset. In previous games I always used to have WASD movement and four directions. However, that can be very limiting and I wanted the player to move in ANY direction. That's why the tileset needs to take diagonal movement into account:\n\nImplementing this into the game with the animation system of my framework braingdx was straight-forward. Here is the result:\nImplemented movement 🏃‍♀️ and rotation 💃Next up: running animation and weapon system.#gamedev @minibeansjam pic.twitter.com/tZO43xUzBu— 〽️ɪɢᴜᴇʟ (@bitbrain_) April 3, 2020  \nEnough for the first day. Time to go to bed! 😴💤\nDay 2: zombie apocalypse\nThe second day was about building out the core mechanics such as implementing shooting and zombies:\nImplemented #box2d physics and shadows. Now I can bump into zombies.Now working on the first weapon, shooting &amp; running animations. pic.twitter.com/MKmT2fP4IH— 〽️ɪɢᴜᴇʟ (@bitbrain_) April 4, 2020  \nMaking zombies was rather easy: I desaturated the colours of the player texture, painted the skin green and made the eyes red:\n\nYes, this means zombies have the same animation as the player, but nobody hopefully notices this! flies away\nShooting in action.Next up: making zombies aggressive and more animations.#minibeansjam5 @minibeansjam pic.twitter.com/TicPbc33EI— 〽️ɪɢᴜᴇʟ (@bitbrain_) April 4, 2020  \nAfter implementing shooting zombies and a health system, it was time to do something entirely different: composing a soundtrack. Since I wanted to save time and I was all on my own, I had to do a few design decisions before composing:\n\nthe track should be repeatable without noticing and should not become boring\nthe track should be rather ambient based\nthe game is action-based but I wanted to keep it horror, so it should not have any percussion work\n\nI spun up my Ableton and came up with this:\n\nI added tons of base and reverb to give a sense of loneliness. Also notice those weird tones towards the end? That's me just randomly punching my MIDI keyboard.\nDay 3: taking shelter\nOn the last day I recorded various sound effects myself:\n\nzombie sounds by moaning into the microphone and pitching it\nfootstep sounds by shaking my leather jacket\nshot impact sounds by squishing a wet towel\ndoor sounds by opening and closing one of our old doors and adding reverb\n\nAlso, there are more sound effects I downloaded from the internet since it was rather difficult to record them myself:\n\ndeath sound\nexplosion sound\nreload sound\nweapon shoot sound\n\nLast words\nThat's how I built the game. Obviously, there was much more stuff done on the code front. Checkout this video to see all the code I wrote during this project:\n\nI just want to thank the other participants for their amazing games (I played them all!) and also give special thanks to Dima (Dmitrij Chotin) for organising this great event.

People are swiping within their apps up and down, left and right, panning in and double tap  whenever they get the opportunity. What people definitely don't want is having to use more than a single finger. When looking at popular apps like Instagram, Twitter or Boost, the entire UX flow is designed for single-hand use. Game developers such as King have taken that principle to another level for a simple reason: Accessibility.\nIf you want your game to be played by the masses, it needs to be accessible. In order for a game to be accessible, it needs to be supported by the hardware and the user should not get confused how to actually play the game. Many mobile games have long and annoying tutorials, explaining the complex UI and input methods such as buttons and virtual HUDs. Personally, I always disliked the fact that controls are being emulated on smartphones via HUDs like this:\n\nEspecially on a busy train or a cigarette in one hand, playing those kind of games can be quite tricky. Why don't all mobile games just have simple One Finger to Rule them All controls?\nSimple controls are challenging\nThere is a simple reason why so many games try to avoid simple input but instead use more complex input mechanisms: it can become rather complicated to communicate how the game can be played, when there is just a single input method! On the other hand, as a user I do not want to read through manuals or tutorials to learn how to actually play the game. Time is much better spent and there are so many games out there which do not require any tutorials whatsoever. Thus, designing a simple input system which can be just with just one finger is key. Before we can implement simple input, the following questions need to be answered:\n\nhow does the player know if he should swipe, pan or where to click?\nhow do I prevent that the player accidentally uses wrong controls?\nhow can I ensure the player learns the controls naturally by just trying out?\n\nAnswering these questions gave me confidence to build all my games with simple controls. This made designing UI components rather hard but eventually paid of by having a really simple game experience.\n\nThe more limited the controls are, the more accessible the game is. However, the amount of input combinations decreases with limited controls.\n\nFinding the perfect balance between those two is the real challenge.\nA first approach\nCurrently I am working on a small game called scape - it is a fast-paced 2D platformer written in Java, using my gamejam framework called braingdx. You play a little virus infecting a compuer system. I got inspired by Yoo Ninja!, one of my favourite Android games:\n\nBasically, the idea is to reach the end of the level without falling out of bounds. Touch the screen to jump (and effectively flip gravity). This is how my game scape loks like:\n\nThe first thing the player does is touching the screen and one notices that the character will jump as a consequence. However, this has some impact on the initial game design:\n\nthe player should not be punished for not touching the screen initially\nthe player should notice that he needs to do something in order to progress\nthe player should also learn in the beginning what the consequences are if no action is taken\n\nTo solve all these questions I did a simple trick: I placed a block in front of the player. As a result the player bumps into the block at some point, gets stuck and the moving camera will kill the player if out of bounds:\n\nThe player has no other choice than trying to touch the screen. Each level has been designed so the player automatically initiates actions to play the game, without having an explicit tutorial:\n\nAs a game designer, this is not obvious at first. Only after a couple of iterations I can eventually refine the level structure to ensure the best possible game experience.\nThe dark side of the moon\nHaving a character jump via touch is not the most difficult mechanic. The One Touch Mechanic made things especially more tricky when it came to menu flow:\n\nhow do I communicate to the player that he has to swipe in order to switch to the next level in the stage selection?\nhow does a player know he needs to touch the screen to enter a level?\nhow does a player know he requires to keep the screen touched to skip a cutscene?\n\nThose questions are just partially answered and I am currently about to rewrite the entire menu flow to improve on that drastically.\nInto the Future\nCurrently I am refining the level design, updating assets and rewriting the level selection flow. In another blog article I am going to elaborate on that more detailed.

Head over to Account Settings -&gt; Developer settings -&gt; Personal access tokens and generate a new token:\n\nYou will not be able to see this token again once generated! Save it somewhere locally in a file for later use.\n\nATTENTION! Never use keys/tokens within your code! Hackers can easily gain access to your account then. Instead, set up Github secrets that you can reference in your scripts.\n\nNext, head to your Github repository configuration page and add secrets:\n\n\nBUTLER_CREDENTIALS is the value of the itch.io key you previously generated\nGH_CREDENTIALS is the value of your Github token you previously generated\n\nIt is very important to use a custom GH_CREDENTIALS within Github actions. Due to a limitation, Github does not trigger any action when the default GITHUB_TOKEN secret is being used to create releases:\n\nReleases created when authenticating with the GITHUB_TOKEN will prevent new workflows from running.\nIf you want to run new workflows, you’ll need to set up a different PAT and add that as a secret.\n\nethomson (Github Staff)\n\n\nCreate a export_presets.cfg file\nWithin Godot, head over to Project -&gt; Export... and create a new export entry:\n\nAlso, make sure to define an export path and give it a name (e.g. yourgame-windows). This will be the name of the game file in itch.io. Saving your configuration automatically generates a export_presets.cfg file that you need to commit to your Github repository. Make sure that your .gitignore does not accidentally exclude this file!\nCreate Github actions\nAfter you setup the secrets within your repository and pushed your export presets, it is now time to configure the Github actions.\nWithin the root of your repository, create a new .github/workflows directory that will contain all the actions (*.yml files).\nCreate release action\nCreate a new file under .github/workflows/create-release.yml:\n\nLet's have a look into the steps. First, we define when the action should get triggered. If you do not want to create a new release\neverytime you push, replace the branch with a different branch, e.g. release\n\nAfterwards, we use the firebelley/godot-export action to build our game. This one requires the export_presets.cfg  to be present in your relative_project_path specified in order to work. Also, it is important to set the environment variable so Github is able to push a new release for us:\n\nThe versioning will be done automatically for you, however you can also provide additional configuration to the action to control the versioning yourself.\nPublish to itch.io action\nThe following example publishes to Windows only, however you can add additional platform releases as additional jobs. Create a new file under .github/workflows/publish-to-itchio.yml:\n\nVoila! Now commit and push everything and it should automatically create a release for you:\n\nAfter the release is created, Github will automatically trigger the next action to publish your game to itch.io:\n\n","id":"https://bitbra.in/blog/publish-godot-game-to-itchio/","title":"How to publish your Godot Game to itch.io via Github actions"},"https://bitbra.in/blog/terminal-setup-on-macos/":{"body":"\nToday I would like to share with you my current terminal setup. It basically consists of the following parts:\n\niTerm2\nzsh\noh-my-zsh\nsorin zsh theme\nMonokai Soda (modified)\n\nThe Terminal\nThe default terminal app on MacOS is definitely lacking of functionality. As xanderdunn has written on Medium, iTerm2 has huge advantages compared to the default terminal:\n\nIt’s a lot more customizable. For example, I can tell it to shut up and never show me warning dialogues when I’m closing a tab or quitting the app when there’s a running process. Customizability ends up being pretty important for serious developers who are always in the terminal.\n\nApart from customisation, iTerm2 allows me to split tabs vertically or horizontally on a native basis (different from tmux where it is virtually implemented). With tmux we could achieve similar behavior, however it would take much longer to set it up and even then it would still not be natively implemented. As a Mac user I always strived for fast and easy setup. When I change my machine I do not want to spend weeks on customising my Terminal. iTerm2 has lots of inbuilt features which could only be added to the default terminal by using plugins.\nThe Shell\nI used many shells such as fish or tmux. After all this time I eventually sticked to zsh for different reasons:\n\namazing community\nlots of customizations\nsyntax highlighting\nlots of available plugins\ninline auto-suggestions\npaginated completion\n\nTo just list some of the great features.\nThe Theme\nWhen I started programming I never thought about customising my terminal or favourite IDE. After many years of trying different things I started to like dark themes. It's 2017 and there are thousands of different themes out there. My favourite is still Monokai, presumably known from the legendary RAM eating machine, called Atom. Monokai has vibrant colours which help me to see things, even at night. It's just preference but I really love vibrant colours (and Tron).\nI use two different things for the appearance: the Monokai Soda theme for colours and the sorin zsh theme theme for the terminal layout. Note that I made the colours of the Soda theme slightly brighter to have an increase in contrast.\nConclusion\nI hope you like my setup.

In this post, I'd like to show you some of them (Godot 4) and maybe you can make use of it, too.\nCombine setters with signals\nYou might find yourself wanting to do something in case a specific variable changes. Now, you could check it either every _tick() or keep track of places where you might change the variable but a much better way is using a setter:\n\nThis then allows anybody outside of that component to react to variable changes by simply connecting to the signal:\n\nThis can be extremely powerful to separate your concerns and responsibilities. Often, we tent to combine everything inside a single node/script but this makes it more difficult to reuse things across the board.\nReusable configurations\nOne challenge is to define configuration for your game. You want to tweak for example the color of your player. This can be done via simple @export variable:\n\nand a corresponding color picker will show up in the Godot UI. However, there are cases where you want to make these configurations reusable. For example, in my game I have a procedural cave generation system where I can control the kinds of ores that should spawn and how they should spawn. I could hardcode this into some form of \"cavegen\" script but what if I want to reuse certain ore spawns for different caves? How do I \"remember\" the configuration without having to duplicate nodes? Resources are the answer:\n\nThis pattern then allows me to accept a list of possible ore spawns in my cave generator like so:\n\nThe generator basically won't care about how the spawn is configured. All it needs to do is call the is_spawnable function for a given seed and x/y position to determine what should be spawned where.\nTorch flickering\nOne challenge I found for my game is to make torches flicker. There is a Light2D those energy I modified over time like so:\n\nDo not ask me how I came up with this abomination of a calculation! It took many hours of tweaking and adjustments. Well, until I realised that this is a silly approach and there is a much better solution by utilizing FastNoiseLite:\n\nThe way it works is that we can basically \"scroll\" from left to right over an infinite noise texture and the current value of the noise texture dictates the intensity of the light. This makes the torch flickering much more smooth and hyper-consistent.\nDay &amp; Night cycle (2D)\nA cheap trick to do a day&amp;night cycle is by using CanvasModulate and working with lerp on Color class:\n\nThis code interpolates the modulate color smoothly between the day, night and evening color. Modifying colors at runtime via lerp is rather powerful!\nInner classes\nClasses in gdscript can be quite powerful and make your life much easier. Often, you see classes mentioned together with inheritance but this is not at all what this is about. I'd rather discourage inheritance as much as possible (I rarely ever use it).\nInstead, classes can help you to make your code more organized and readable. Let me show you.\nLet's say you have to store some information about your game state. You might utilise a dictionary for that:\n\nWhile this can work, it is very difficult to understand at a glance what e.g. data[\"waves\"][0] contains. Yes, with the recent addition of types to dictionaries and arrays, gdscript can tell us the type, but the type itself will be just another dictionary. You end up in a jungle of dictionaries and arrays and it becomes much more difficult to wrap your head around things, especially when you need to debug an issue.\nClasses come to the rescue and they can make things much more readable and organized:\n\nThe beauty of this is that these classes are purely internal to your script and do not need to be exposed. There is also no inheritance or any other complex concept. This pattern uses classes purely as named data container.\nUnique ids\nSometimes, you might need unique ids. Using a counter could work but it brings its own problems: it is state dependent and therefore you need to \"remember\" the counter somehow. There are various algorithms that generate a random strings, such as the UUID spec however, in gdscript you can create something much simpler: Nano ID. I am using this exact script in my RPG data management plugin called Pandora to generate entity ids:\n\nThen you can use it as such:\n\nI hope you found these somewhat useful. Rock and stone! 💎⛏️\n","id":"https://bitbra.in/blog/useful-gdscript-patterns/","title":"Useful gdscript patterns"},"https://bitbra.in/blog/why-i-still-use-java-for-gamedev/":{"body":"There is an technology, running on billions of devices every single day: Java.\nMany developers (beardy hipsters) claim this technology belongs to the past, game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine are the future! Still, there is one man who hasn't lost hope. Every single day he is building real games, not written in C# or Javascript. Not even Python or scientific C++. He is just using Java. And this person is me.\n\nThis picture isn't showing my living room. This is Unreal Engine. Playable in VR. With 60fps at 4K resolution! Awesome, right?\nThe simple alternative\nUnfortunately I didn't create this. But hey, I can show you something amazing I did back then, in Java:\n\nOkay, I get you. Why am I doing this to myself? Why not just using a game engine like everyone else? It would have so many advantages to use any game engine of my choice compared to this ancient crap I am doing:\n\ncomplete 2D/3D editors for modeling\ninbuilt physics, lighting and rainbow machine 🌈\namazing graphics, shader editors\nalmost no programming skillz required! Just drag and drop all your stuff!\nand much more...\n\nWell, the answer is quite simple: I like to remind myself everyday where I started. My first game was written in Delphi Pascal. Back then I even didn't know much about OOP or Design Patterns. The only thing I cared about was moving pixels on the screen. It was truly inspiring and it didn't change, even eight years later.\nGetting started with gamedev\nMany games have been completed by now and the majority of those games is written in \"pure\" Java. Not exactly pure Java, I am using libraries to access OpenGL but generally I can say that most games are 100% written by hand, without an actual game engine or predefined templating.\nHow do I do this? To make a game in Java you basically need three things:\n\nJava skills\nBasic understanding of math (ideally vectors, functions and matrices)\nKnow how to set/move pixels on the screen and how to handle input\n\nPoint 1 and 2 are straight-forward: if you know basically how Java works you can write programms which do stuff for you:\n\nIn addition you need to know math. For example you could write an immutable vector in Java with basic addition and subtraction functionality:\n\nYou can do that with many different concepts and in the end you have a small library to implement math into your game. For example, turning around a player or calculating the distance between two game objects can be simply done by using vectors.\nGiving birth to your game\nWhat about moving pixels on the screen? Java already has libraries like Swing or JavaFX and I could have easily used that to write games. It seems crazy to go down the Java path for game development but I am not completely stupid. All gamers have powerful graphics cards and it would be absolutely mental not to use them. These GUI libraries rely on Software Rendering by default, which means the CPU does all the work. So we need a better solution if we want to make a highly performing 3D shooter or the next WoW.\n\nMiguel, why not using an Engine then?\n\nBeeep, wrong question! Why bothering with a complex game engine when you can just include a small library which provides all those features for you?\n\ncomplete 2D/3D editors for modeling\ninbuilt physics, lighting and rainbow machine 🌈\namazing graphics, shaders\nand much more...\n\nSounds familiar? I'll present to you libgdx:\n\nYes, this library let me do all this fancy game engine stuff, but in Java! Everything rendered on my GTX 93849 Extreme Ultra HD Power 5000 Graphics Card (without FPS limit an initial empty game gets ~15000fps, whoops). Nowadays I takes me 30 minutes to create a simple 3D Snake game in Java. In under 200 lines of code. Without touching any game engine. You're not believing me? Then you have to wait for a next blog article.\nWhy libgdx?\nThis library allows me to combine it with my Java knowledge to write games the same way as you would write a small Swing application. Furthermore it is cross-plattform compatible, so the Java game runs on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android and even iOS!\nMoreover I really love Java. During the past years I worked with several programming languages, frameworks and libraries, however Java always was the easiest and simplest to work with. For example, C# is great as well. It even has features like Delegates and Properties which I really miss in Java. Also C++ is great to work with. Compile natively and have very low overhead, compared to Java. A simple SDL game written in C++ (proc-gen, without assets) can be around ~40kb, while the same game in Java is easily 8MB in size (all required .jar libraries need to get packed in the fat-jar). That's an increase of 2000%. Still, we're living in 2017 and file size doesn't matter anymore (mostly). In terms of resource management Java doesn't do that well compared to C++ but as I said, our computers are monster machines, we just don't care anymore.\nConservative and old-fashioned?\nDo I enjoy Java too much? Probably yes. Could I save lot of time when writing larger games by using an actual game engine? Maybe. Do I want to learn various game engines by heart? Definitely. I am not saying that I blindly refuse to do something different than Java. Regardless, it's the most fun way to do what I love.\n\nDo what you want independent of technology, library or game engine. It does't matter how you do it. It doesn't matter how long it takes to get there. The only thing which matters is that you are doing what you love.\n\n- Miguel\n","id":"https://bitbra.in/blog/why-i-still-use-java-for-gamedev/","title":"Why I still use Java for gamedev"},"https://bitbra.in/blog/workflow-of-releasing-gem-based-jekyll-theme/":{"body":"This Jekyll-based blog has been built with a custom theme created called jekyll-dash. Initially, I built this theme just to share it with others, however, more and more people started using it over the past few months.\n\nIn this article I want to highlight some of the challenges I faced trying to maintain this theme for a lot of people and the workflow I introduced that helped me to overcome these challenges.\nAn \"auto-update\" theme\nWhen I first started this theme I found it quite annoying that I constantly had to manually update my Jekyll files such as layouts, Sass and pages to apply a change to my blog. Especially, when trying to keep the theme in its own dedicated repository this can become a demanding chore.\nThe solution to this was to bundle my theme as a so called Ruby gem and then use that gem within the _config.yml of Jekyll:\n\nJekyll will automatically apply the theme if it is specified as a gem within Gemfile:\n\nWhenever I push a new version of the gem to the public rubygems repository, rebuilding my site would use the new changes and automatically include them - neat!\nLimitations of Github Pages\nUnfortunately, I quickly had to realise that a lot of people were unable to use my theme natively within Github pages. Github are actually the creators behind Jekyll and when you create a repository containing Jekyll files, it will automatically build them for you and publish them when the Github pages feature is enabled.\nThere was just one problem: Github pages did not support Jekyll 4.x at the moment of this writing but only Jekyll 3.x. This becomes a problem because my theme was natively built with Jekyll 4.\nTherefore, I had to introduce a multi-version workflow:\n\nversion 1.x will support Jekyll 3\nversion 2.x will support Jekyll 4\n\nI created separate branches for those and specified the Jekyll version explicitly within the .gemspec file of jekyll-dash:\n\nThis worked very well for my usecase and I was able to use the theme natively in Github pages.\nFor what reason would I want to use Jekyll outside of the native Github pages integration then? Well, due to security reasons, Github Pages does only allow a very specific set of Jekyll plugins to be enabled. This restricts customisation of the site. For example, I also needed the following features:\n\ngravatar support\nauto-generated tags and tag cloud\n\nThe solution was to build the site externally outside of Github Pages but then push the generated site onto a Github Pages enabled repository. I achieved that by using travis-ci.org which became eventually difficult to manage. As a result, I left Travis behind and moved over to Github Actions.\nImproving the workflow\nMy initial release workflow looked as follows:\n\npush a new commit to the main branch containing the updated version within the .gemspec\npush a new tag for the given commit\nrelease the gem (see script below)\n\n\nThere were a couple of issues with this approach:\n\nthe pipeline ran outside of Github while Github support Github Actions out-of-the-box\nunable to see what each release entails, as Github releases and git tags were not created for a new release\ndifficult to manage multiple major versions, as this pipeline would always deploy what the tag said. I had to be very careful to not cause unecessary merge conflicts\nindividual commits were not really built and tested. Especially for people trying to make contributions it was difficult to tell if their change would break the Jekyll build\n\nI discarded this workflow and introduced a completely new one built from scratch based on Github Actions:\n\nBuild jekyll site for each individual commit and report on its status code\nWhen committing to the branches main (v2.x) and 1.x (v1.x) respectively, do the following:\n\nextract the current gem version from the .gemspec file with a custom-built Github action\ncheck git history if a tag for the extracted gem version exists already\nin case the tag does not exist yet, create a new git tag and push a new Github release\n\n\nWhenever a new tag has been pushed, build and publish the gem for that tag to rubygems.org\n\n\nIn order to check that the gem version exists as a tag, I am using the github-tag-action:\n\nThis allows me then to apply an if conditional on any other steps:\n\nThe slightly tricky part was to extract the version from the .gemspec file. For that I build my own Github Action that is using parse-gemspec-cli to extract the metadata accordingly:\n\nThis new workflow allows me to build and test every single commit and it gives me full control of when I want to release a new gem: I simply bump the version of the gem manually within the .gemspec and Github will do the rest for me!\n","id":"https://bitbra.in/blog/workflow-of-releasing-gem-based-jekyll-theme/","title":"Workflow of releasing a gem-based Jekyll theme"}},"docInfo":{"https://bitbra.in/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://bitbra.in/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://bitbra.in/blog/automatically-publish-games-to-itchio/":{"body":273,"title":4},"https://bitbra.in/blog/cd-with-travis/":{"body":533,"title":4},"https://bitbra.in/blog/creating-braingdx-orthogonal-tilemaps/":{"body":636,"title":4},"https://bitbra.in/blog/devlog-youtubers/":{"body":472,"title":3},"https://bitbra.in/blog/godot-addon-compatibility/":{"body":331,"title":6},"https://bitbra.in/blog/godot-file-compression/":{"body":553,"title":3},"https://bitbra.in/blog/godot-types/":{"body":283,"title":5},"https://bitbra.in/blog/goodbye-jekyll/":{"body":281,"title":2},"https://bitbra.in/blog/host-your-own-blog-for-free-with-custom-domain/":{"body":351,"title":5},"https://bitbra.in/blog/how-i-animated-scape/":{"body":477,"title":2},"https://bitbra.in/blog/level-generation-in-mindmazer/":{"body":252,"title":3},"https://bitbra.in/blog/minibeansjam5-building-a-game/":{"body":924,"title":5},"https://bitbra.in/blog/new-blog/":{"body":81,"title":2},"https://bitbra.in/blog/one-finger-to-rule-them-all/":{"body":443,"title":5},"https://bitbra.in/blog/publish-godot-game-to-itchio/":{"body":340,"title":7},"https://bitbra.in/blog/terminal-setup-on-macos/":{"body":224,"title":3},"https://bitbra.in/blog/useful-gdscript-patterns/":{"body":398,"title":3},"https://bitbra.in/blog/why-i-still-use-java-for-gamedev/":{"body":549,"title":4},"https://bitbra.in/blog/workflow-of-releasing-gem-based-jekyll-theme/":{"body":462,"title":6}},"length":21},"lang":"English"}
