This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based blog has been built with a custom theme created called [jekyll-dash](https://github.com/bitbrain/jekyll-dash). Initially, I built this theme just to share it with others, however, more and more people started using it over the past few months.

In this article I want to highlight some of the challenges I faced trying to maintain this theme for a lot of people and the workflow I introduced that helped me to overcome these challenges.

# An "auto-update" theme

When I first started this theme I found it quite annoying that I constantly had to manually update my Jekyll files such as layouts, Sass and pages to apply a change to my blog. Especially, when trying to keep the theme in its [own dedicated repository](https://github.com/bitbrain/jekyll-dash) this can become a demanding chore.

The solution to this was to bundle my theme as a so called [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/) and then use that gem within the `_config.yml` of Jekyll:
```yml
theme: jekyll-dash
```
Jekyll will automatically apply the theme if it is specified as a gem within `Gemfile`:
```
gem 'jekyll-dash'
```
Whenever I push a new version of the gem to the public rubygems repository, rebuilding my site would use the new changes and automatically include them - neat!

# Limitations of Github Pages

Unfortunately, I quickly had to realise that a lot of people were unable to use my theme natively within Github pages. Github are actually the creators behind Jekyll and when you create a repository containing Jekyll files, it will automatically build them for you and publish them [when the Github pages feature is enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

There was just one problem: [Github pages did not support Jekyll 4.x](https://pages.github.com/versions/) at the moment of this writing but only Jekyll 3.x. This becomes a problem because my theme was natively built with Jekyll 4.

Therefore, I had to introduce a multi-version workflow:

- version `1.x` will support Jekyll 3
- version `2.x` will support Jekyll 4

I created separate branches for those and specified the Jekyll version explicitly within the `.gemspec` file of [jekyll-dash](https://github.com/bitbrain/jekyll-dash/blob/main/jekyll-dash.gemspec):
```
spec.add_runtime_dependency "jekyll", "~> 4.0"
```
This worked very well for my usecase and I was able to use the theme natively in Github pages.

For what reason would I want to use Jekyll outside of the native Github pages integration then? Well, due to security reasons, Github Pages does only allow a very specific set of Jekyll plugins to be enabled. This restricts customisation of the site. For example, I also needed the following features:

- gravatar support
- auto-generated tags and tag cloud

The solution was to build the site externally outside of Github Pages but then push the generated site [onto a Github Pages enabled repository](https://github.com/bitbrain/bitbrain.github.io). I achieved that by using [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/) which became eventually difficult to manage. As a result, I left Travis behind and moved over to [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

# Improving the workflow

My initial release workflow looked as follows:

1. push a new commit to the `main` branch containing the updated version within the `.gemspec`
2. push a new tag for the given commit
3. release the gem (see script below)

```yml
before_install:
- gem install bundler -v 2.0.1
script:
- bundle install
deploy:
  provider: rubygems
  api_key: $RUBYGEMS_API_KEY
  gem: jekyll-dash
  on:
    tags: true
    repo: bitbrain/jekyll-dash
```
There were a couple of issues with this approach:

- the pipeline ran outside of Github while Github support Github Actions out-of-the-box
- unable to see what each release entails, as Github releases and git tags were not created for a new release
- difficult to manage multiple major versions, as this pipeline would always deploy what the tag said. I had to be very careful to not cause unecessary merge conflicts
- individual commits were not really built and tested. Especially for people trying to make contributions it was difficult to tell if their change would break the Jekyll build

I discarded this workflow and introduced a completely new one built from scratch based on **Github Actions**:

1. Build jekyll site for each individual commit and report on its status code
2. When committing to the branches `main` (v2.x) and `1.x` (v1.x) respectively, do the following:
    - extract the current gem version from the .gemspec file [with a custom-built Github action](https://github.com/bitbrain/gemspec-fetch)
    - check git history if a tag for the extracted gem version exists already
    - in case the tag does not exist yet, create a new git tag and push a new Github release
3. Whenever a new tag has been pushed, build and publish the gem for that tag to rubygems.org

In order to check that the gem version exists as a tag, I am using the `github-tag-action`:
```yml
- name: üíé Extract gemspec info
  id: gemspec_fetch
  uses: bitbrain/gemspec-fetch@1.0.0
  with:
    specfile: jekyll-dash.gemspec
- name: üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è investigate if tag exists
  uses: mukunku/tag-exists-action@v1.0.0
  id: tag-check
  with: 
    tag: {% raw %}'v${{ steps.gemspec_fetch.outputs.version }}'{% endraw %}
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GH_CREDENTIALS }}{% endraw %}
```
This allows me then to apply an `if` conditional on any other steps:
```yml
- name: üîñBuild tag
  if: {% raw %}${{ steps.tag-check.outputs.exists == 'false' }}{% endraw %}
  id: tag_version
  uses: mathieudutour/github-tag-action@v5.6
  with:
    github_token: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GH_CREDENTIALS }}{% endraw %}
    default_bump: false
    custom_tag:  {% raw %}${{ steps.gemspec_fetch.outputs.version }}{% endraw %}
    tag_prefix: v
```
The slightly tricky part was to extract the version from the .gemspec file. For that I build [my own Github Action](https://github.com/bitbrain/gemspec-fetch) that is using [parse-gemspec-cli](https://github.com/packsaddle/ruby-parse_gemspec-cli) to [extract the metadata accordingly](https://github.com/bitbrain/gemspec-fetch/blob/main/entrypoint.sh):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

SPEC_DATA=$(parse-gemspec-cli $INPUT_SPECFILE)

echo "::set-output name=name::$(echo $SPEC_DATA | jq -r '.name')"
echo "::set-output name=description::$(echo $SPEC_DATA | jq -r '.description')"
echo "::set-output name=summary::$(echo $SPEC_DATA | jq -r '.summary')"
echo "::set-output name=version::$(echo $SPEC_DATA | jq -r '.version')"
echo "::set-output name=homepage::$(echo $SPEC_DATA | jq -r '.homepage')"
```
This new workflow allows me to build and test every single commit and it gives me full control of when I want to release a new gem: I simply bump the version of the gem manually within the .gemspec and Github will do the rest for me!
