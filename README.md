## Setup

I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and my custom [Jekyll Dash theme](https://github.com/bitbrain/jekyll-dash). If you want to learn how to set up your own Jekyll blog including a custom domain, [I have written a blog post here](https://bitbra.in/2021/10/03/host-your-own-blog-for-free-with-custom-domain.html).
